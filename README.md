This Repository holds all code used in the University project for the course "Project: From Model to Production" by the IU Internationale Hochschule. The project was conducted by Jan Bittner.

It contains 3 files:
  - train_model.ipynb
  - endpoint_create.ipynb
  - batch_pred_pipeline.ipynb
All 3 contain code to interact with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio. Note that there are parts that are left blank due to not wanting to expose credentials or authentication.
